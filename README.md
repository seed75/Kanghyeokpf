Kanghyeok Lee — Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!  
This project showcases my work as a **Junior Front-End Developer**, featuring my selected web applications and professional experience.

- Overview

Built using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS v4**,  
this portfolio is designed to be simple, responsive, and elegant —  
with smooth transitions between light (Cream White) and dark modes.
